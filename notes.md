### Notes
- https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/#getstarted
- Read `The Hundred Page Machine Learning Book`, it explains alot: https://themlbook.com/wiki/doku.php?id=contents
- gnuplot -> plot "cost.txt" with lines = graph out cost curve
- y = w(x) OR y = w(x) - b
- goal -> w(x) - b = 0
- square result from cost function to get more amplified result
- input is usually a feature vector
	1. Any value for w
	2. Give to w to cost function to get prediction precision (close to 0, the more precise and accurate)
	3. w - derivative of cost function (limit as h->0)
	4. Apply learning rate
	5. Iterate many times
- Steps
	1. Import data into matricies
	2. Randomize numbers in bias and weight matricies
	3. Run finite_diff and learn a number of times
- tqdm (progress bar)
- Gradient descent is basic machine learning algo## Notes

### Ideas
- Understand linear algebra and calculus applications in machine learning
- Gender guessing based on height and weight in Python
- Python neural network class to use for other things
- Machine learning library in C
- Raspberry PI ml video object or person detection (first with something like opencv then myself)?
- Turning Handwritten Documents into Digitized Versions
- Stock Market Predicition
- Something like ChatGPT that sites it's sources will over take Google as a search engine
