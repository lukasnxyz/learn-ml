### Machine-Learning-Practice

#### Notes
- y = w(x) OR y = w(x) - b
- goal -> w(x) - b = 0
- square result from cost function to get more amplified result
- input is usually a feature vector
- gnuplot -> plot "cost.txt" with lines = graph out cost curve

#### Steps
1. Any value for w
2. Give to w to cost function to get prediction precision (close to 0, the more precise and accurate)
3. w - derivative of cost function (limit as h->0)
4. Apply learning rate
5. Iterate many times
