## learn-ml
This is a basic learning plan I'm working on to get up to speed on the basics of machine learning and
understanding the fields ML, DL and other related topics for becoming an ML/Software Engineer. This
guide will be a work in progress as I am learning along side finding the proper resources to learn
from.

#### Other tips and motivation
Self study is very difficult so having a set plan like one would have in a school system will help a lot.
[Here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-for-programmers/) you can find a good guide on
machine learning for software developers. It goes more for the top down approach of learning instead of
bottom up, but an interesting read nonetheless.
[An interesting article on how to learn on your own](https://metacademy.org/roadmaps/rgrosse/learn_on_your_own)
Know what [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) is.

#### Bottom up method
You can jump around within each step. I would advise to just skim the Stanford lectures if you understand
how the previous topics work from implementing them.
