### Machine-Learning-Practice

#### Notes
- y = w(x)
- square result from cost function to get more amplified result

#### Steps
1. Any value for w
2. Give to w to cost function to get prediction precision (close to 0, the more precise and accurate)
3. w - derivative of cost function (limit as h->0)
4. Apply learning rate
5. Iterate many times
