### General notes
- Progress bar in python: tqdm
- A tensor is just a representaiton of a scalar/vector/matrix/etc. so an object with dimension and shape
- Gradient descent is basic machine learning algo
- y = w(x) OR y = w(x) - b
- goal -> w(x) - b = 0
- square result from cost function to get more amplified result
- input is usually a feature vector
	1. Any value for w
	2. Give to w to cost function to get prediction precision (close to 0, the more precise and accurate)
	3. w - derivative of cost function (limit as h->0)
	4. Apply learning rate
	5. Iterate many times

### Ideas
- Python neural network class to use for other things
- Crypto Predicition
- Something like ChatGPT that sites it's sources will over take Google as a search engine

### Steps to learn first
1. [DSA](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/)
2. [ML algorithms course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9V3DapHEDA)
3. something with neural netoworks and deep learning
4. RNNs, Transformers and GAN based models
