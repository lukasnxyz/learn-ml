### General notes
- Progress bar in python: tqdm
- A tensor is just a representaiton of a scalar/vector/matrix/etc. so an object with dimension and shape
- Gradient descent is basic machine learning algo
- y = w(x) OR y = w(x) - b
- goal -> w(x) - b = 0
- square result from cost function to get more amplified result
- input is usually a feature vector
	1. Any value for w
	2. Give to w to cost function to get prediction precision (close to 0, the more precise and accurate)
	3. w - derivative of cost function (limit as h->0)
	4. Apply learning rate
	5. Iterate many times

### Ideas
- Python neural network class to use for other things
- Crypto Predicition
- Something like ChatGPT that sites it's sources will over take Google as a search engine

### Learning steps (bottom up)
Types of ML
- Supervised algorithms (regression, classification)
- Unsupervised and semi-supervised algorithms (clustering, dimensionality reduction, graph-based algorithms)
- Deep learning (CNNs and RNNs)
- Reinforcement learning (dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, heuristic methods)

Different tasks
- Computer vision (e.g.: classification, object detection, semantic segmentation)
- Natural language processing (e.g.: text classification, sentiment analysis, language modeling, machine translation)
- Recommending systems
- Classic machine learning
